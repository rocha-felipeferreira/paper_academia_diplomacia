### Abstract

How Brazilian academy â€“ specialized in international relations â€“ used the concepts of Latin America and South America in articles published in national journals from 1985 to 2015? Is it feasible to affirm that there is a significant mean difference between the period before and after the year 2000? To address these issues, this paper makes use of methodo-logical tools provided by Content Analysis and statistics values to understand how scholars have dealt with conceptual interests of Brazilian diplomacy - both presidential and tra-ditional versions. Therefore, we analyzed a thousand and fifty-five publications from two national high-impact journals in the discipline of international relations in Brazil. Thus, the results indicate that although the concept of South America has gained a larger space, is still the concept of Latin America that is most used by researchers
